1.
The round started:
2.
Player A bought a ticket (price 10000 ANMP，equal to 1 USD) to participate and got a number ‘1’
The 10000 ANMP goes to the lottery pool
So 10000 ANMP in the pool, and only number ‘1’ participating.
3.
Then player B bought a ticket too, and got a number ‘2’
So 20000 ANMP in the pool, and two numbers participating.
4.
Player C number ‘3’
Player D number ‘4’
...
In this round, there are 50 players participated, they got number ‘1’ to ‘50’ on there tickets.
So 500000 ANMP in the lottery pool, 50 numbers participating.
5.
